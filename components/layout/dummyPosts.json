    "html": "<p>Like any other indsutry software development is not left behind in terms of myths floating around freely everywhere. Let's debunk a few in this article.</p><h3 id=\"1-one-programming-language-is-better-than-others\">1. One programming language is better than others</h3><p>Developers working for a long time in a programming language builds up a kind of attachment to its syntax, tools and other things in its ecosystem. Which is relatable to what we all humans do with other things in our life. For example the first bike, car, house, games, toys etc. Due to this feeling of attachement many developers don't appreciate the fact that every programming language is good and bad in its different uses cases and no one language can perform well in all the areas of software development. In many large scale softwares a single task or service may require multiple programming languages.</p><h3 id=\"2-writing-code-is-the-only-thing-developers-do\">2. Writing code is the only thing developers do</h3><p>Software development is a practice of comming up with a solution in terms of a computer program which can solve the given problem and it can be of industry Healtcare, Coal Mining, Education, Travel, Auto Mobile, Banking etc. To solve the problems with a computer software the developers based on thier roles and experience have to figure out the functioning on the software through designs and divide the problem into several parts so that it can be managed easily and then after the planning and design documents developers have to tackle down each task in a team via writing code. But this not applies to small personal projects.</p><h3 id=\"3-development-should-be-as-fast-as-possible\">3. Development should be as fast as possible</h3><p>In every project dedicating time to planning and gathering the requirements and then trying to fillup all time requiremnts brings up the best result. As mentioned software development is not just about writing code and forcing the developers to skip the necessary steps and just work long hours to release the project as soon as possible will hinder their productivity and thus may results in poor software in the end.</p><h3 id=\"4-adding-a-new-feature-is-a-super-easy\">4. Adding a new feature is a super easy</h3><p>Many times non-technical people thinks that adding a new feature is just a piece of cake but it depends alot on the structure of the codebase as developing a software in a scalable manner is a very difficult task and there's alot of design patterns and practices to follow and many times some developers changes might conflict with the current changes and in worst case senarios can even crash the whole software it was not handeled properly. Adding new features can also break existing featues or cause bugs to the existing features.</p><h3 id=\"5-testing-is-not-necessary\">5. Testing is not necessary</h3><p>Many developers specially the beginners or intermediate developers after working on some software projects starts thinking that they can write in a way which is surely not going to have any errors on the runtime and they don't need any tests for the code they have added but companies have software testers because they don't want to risk thier user exeprience over a bug or a crash in their application and that's why experienced software developers understand that testing is crucial part of the sotware development process and specially in the case of dynamic languages testing becomes a must on every part. Because it is true that we all improve from our mistakes or learning from others mistakes and the same applies to software developent erros will happen no matter how much experience you have every error will end up teaching you something throught the software developemnt journey.</p>",

It is possible to make a 2D or 3D only by a single developer or by a company of any size. Game Development is huge term which involves roles like sound designers, animation developers, mechanics developers, physics developers, game engine developers and more. All these roles comes under the category of game development.</p><h3 id=\"types-of-games-from-history-to-21st-century\">Types of games from history to 21st century:</h3><ol><li>The first generation (2D Games) - 2D Games are created with flat graphics called sprites and don't have any 3D geometry. These games were the first generation of games that early days consoles and computsers can offer. They were created using programming languages like C and C++. In those days as computers were not much powerful to render good 3D graphics and it was also hard to make games without using modern frameworks that exists today.</li><li>The second generation (3D Games) - 3D Games uses three dimensional geometry which involves creation of worlds and spaces that uses the same principles of our own world as a foundation for creating their own 3D environments. For example in a 3D game when users gets closer to the objects it appears larger in size. In the early days of 3D games it was hard to create games with libraries such as OpenGL so game enginers like Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot comes into picture and offers GUI interfaces and scripting languages like C#, JavaScript, Lua and more.</li><li>The third generation (AR/VR Games) - Argumented Reality and Virtual Reality seems similiar to most people but in reality the both are different from each other. In simple words AR is way to integrate information from a computer to real world objects and make them both work interactively with each others. On the other hand VR is a artifically generated simulation of real world or a totally different from real world which a user can interact with in real time as if the user is currently in the same simulated environment. These AR/VR games are the new types of games which are supported by frameworks like Unity and Unreal Engine.</li></ol><h3 id=\"roles-of-responsibilities-of-a-game-developer\">Roles of responsibilities of a Game Developer:</h3><ul><li>Designing thier or using others assets</li><li>Level design</li><li>Concepts design</li><li>Sound design if necessary</li><li>Scripting</li><li>Server Design if necessary</li></ul><h3 id=\"how-much-time-it-takes-to-become-a-game-developer\">How much time it takes to become a Game Developer?</h3><ol><li>2D Games - They are generally beginner friendly and requires 2D maths only. Beginners can start with frameworks like game maker studio and unity but before learning these frameworks one should have a good understanding of any one programming language which will take around 4 to 8 weeks.</li><li>3D Games - These games are slightly more complicated than 2D games but depends alot on how good a user is in physics and 3D maths but still it does not requires so much maths as it depends on the use case and frameworks like Unity and Unreal Enginer already do a lot of heavy lifting behind the scenes. For a beginner directly learning 3D games development without experience in 2D games will take around 12 to 30 weeks but depends on the person as well.</li><li>AR/VR - These are the modern way of creating games but still not widely adopted but have great future in the gaming industry development of these are games are more complicated than 3D games. It is better to learn how to make 3D games before jumping directly into AR/VR games but its not necessary. Unity and Unreal Engine also supports the development of these games. For a beginner directly learning AR/VR games development without having an experience in 3D games will take around 12 to 30 weeks but depends on the person as well.</li></ol>",

Initially mobile apps development was only possible with the native development solutions but as time goes and business needs changes the need for Hybrid and Cross Platform apps development arises. </p><h3 id=\"difference-between-native-hybrid-and-cross-platform-apps\">Difference between Native, Hybrid and Cross Platform Apps:</h3><ol><li>Native - Native Apps are those applications which are created using the native SDK, programming language and tools provided by the OS. Native apps are not portable means they can only run on the OS for which they are specifically being created.<br>Android supports C++, Java and Kotlin for its native apps development.<br>iOS supports Objective-C and Swift for its native apps development.</li><li>Hybrid - Hybrid Apps are those applications which are created using web based programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript because they uses mobile's web view object and they are not good for CPU intensive work due to not being a native app.</li><li>Cross Platform - Cross Platform Apps are those applications which can be created using one programming language and can support multiple OS's and they build native applications seprately for both the OS's this helps companies reduce thier development costs. ReactNative and Flutter these two tools are very famous and used heavily in the Cross Platform apps development.</li></ol><h3 id=\"two-famous-mobile-oss-for-cross-platform-apps\">Two famous mobile OS's for cross platform apps:</h3><ul><li>Android - It is an open source operating system based on Linux Kernel developed by Andy Rubin in September 2008 and its currently the most popular operating system of 2021. It is easily available in any smart phone these days and it has a huge apps eco system.</li><li>iOS - It is a mobile operating system created by Apple Inc in June 2007. It is not an open source operating system and only runs on Apple's iPhones and other iOS supported Apple devices. Due to not being open source its is the second most popular operating system in 2021.</li></ul><h3 id=\"cross-platform-apps-development-frameworks\">Cross Platform Apps Development Frameworks:</h3><ol><li>React Native - It is an open source mobile apps development framework created by Facebook in 2015. Since its first launch it has taken a huge share in the market of mobile apps development and now one of the most used Cross Platform Apps development framework. It supports JavaScript and TypeScript for the development of mobile apps.</li><li>Flutter - Flutter is an open source UI SDK (software development kit) created by Google in 2017. It not only supports cross platform apps for mobile devices but also for desktops os as well. It is written in C, C++ and Dart. Since its release it has also taken a great spot in the cross platofrm apps development market. Dart is primiraly used to create applications using Flutter.</li><li>Xamrain - It is an open source platform for building cross platform iOS, Android and Windows aplications using .NET services. It was created in 2011 and later owned by Microsoft.</li></ol><h3 id=\"roles-and-responsibilites-of-a-react-native-or-flutter-developer\">Roles and Responsibilites of a React Native or Flutter Developer:</h3><ol><li>Structue the layout</li><li>Defining the routes for navigation</li><li>Managing different states</li><li>Interacting with internal and external APIs</li><li>Interacting with a backend server if necessary</li><li>Improving efficiency and fixing bugs in the apps</li></ol><h3 id=\"how-much-time-it-takes-to-become-one-of-these-developer\">How much time it takes to become one of these developer?</h3><ol><li>React Native - The prerequisite for making apps using react native is basic knowledge of either JavaScript or TypeScript. Beginners usually starts with JavaScript and learning basics of it will take around 4 to 5 weeks. Understanding the frameworks itself will take 1 to 2 weeks.</li><li>Flutter - The flutter frameworks uses Dart to create apps.

It is written in programming languages like C, C++, Objective-C, Assembly and Swift. As iOS is not an open source free operating system it can only be available in Apple products. People must have to buy Apple devices in order to use iOS. It is one of the most premium OS as Apple devices are really high quality and expensive. Not being open source in nature other phones manufacturing companies can not release their products with iOS installed and they usually ship their devices with Android OS instead and that's the reason being Android the most popular OS and then iOS comes after taking up the second place in most popular OS.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-ios-apps-development\">What is iOS Apps Development?</h3><p>iOS apps development is the practice of creating applications for iOS devices in the form of UIs (User Interfaces). In the early days of iOS Object-C was the only and official programming language to create iOS applications but later Apple has introduced a new programming language called Swift to meet the needs of modern and fast development and Swift is the current official programming language for creating iOS applications. Swift is very fast and easy to understand as it has less boilerplate and syntax compared to Objective-C.</p><h3 id=\"roles-and-responsibilities-of-an-ios-developer\"><br>Roles and Responsibilities of an iOS Developer:</h3><ul><li>Structuring the layout UI</li><li>Designing Routes for better UX</li><li>Interacting with server if needed</li><li>Interacting with various internal and external APIs</li><li>Writing clean code</li><li>Managing app efficiency and responsiveness across all targeted devices.</li></ul><h3 id=\"how-much-time-it-will-take-to-become-an-ios-developer\">How much time it will take to become an iOS developer?</h3><p>The time to become and iOS developer varies from person to person and the amount of time one has spent in learning about the iOS ecosystem. The first step is to learn the basics of Swift programming language which includes concepts like (statements, expressions, operators, variables, constants, functions, arrays, loops, objects, classes) and more. After getting familiar with the basics of Swift which will take around 4 to 8 weeks then one can start iOS apps development using Xcode which is an IDE (integrated development environment) created by Apple for easier the development of iOS and MacOS applications. MacOS app development also supports Swift. Learning how to design and structure a iOS application in Xcode will take around 4 to 8 weeks again because developers work with libraries most of the time and prevent re-inventing the wheel. Working with other people code and understanding it takes time.</p><h3 id=\"popular-courses-to-learn-ios-development-online\"><br>Popular courses to learn iOS development online:</h3><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/\">iOS &amp; Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp</a> - by <strong>Dr. Angela Yu</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/swiftui-masterclass-course-ios-development-with-swift/\">SwiftUI Masterclass 2021 - iOS 15 App Development &amp; Swift 5</a> - by <strong>Robert Petras</strong></li></ol>",

Android Developers primiraly creates apps for Smart Phones. Android Developers make apps which can function offline and online.<br>Android apps which provides services with the use of internet interacts with a server acting as the backend service of that application. Android apps can now a days provide 3D, VR, AR experiences to user.</p><h3 id=\"programming-languages-used-in-android-developmet\">Programming Languages Used in Android Developmet:</h3><ol><li>Java - It was the first primiraly used programming langauge for android apps development. Java has a powerful set of open source libraries which helps in the development of android apps. Now a days it is not the first choice for creating apps and its no more the official app development langauge of Android.</li><li>Kotlin - It is a new programming language and Google has announced it as the official app development langauge for the Android. Kotlin has become very famous because it has a very good syntax and developers can achive the same results with less code than Java.

CSS enables developers to create beautiful designs on the web. CSS is the only language in the design ecosystem and is an essential skill for front-end developers.</li><li>JavaScript - It is used to make the websites interactive so that the user can have dynamic responses as well and different experience from other users using the same website.
